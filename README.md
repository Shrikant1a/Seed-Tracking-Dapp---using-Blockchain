# GreenLedger

A modern, minimal seed tracking dApp built with **React** and **Vite**, leveraging **Blockchain** technology for enhanced transparency and traceability. This project was forked from [Seed-Tracking-Dapp---using-Blockchain](https://github.com/Shrikant1a/Seed-Tracking-Dapp---using-Blockchain).

## ✨ Features

- **Fast React Development:** Bootstrapped with Vite for blazing-fast HMR and optimized performance.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Smart contract logic using Solidity to ensure secure, immutable records.
- **Minimal Boilerplate:** Clean, beginner-friendly starter structure.
- **ESLint Preconfigured:** Ship production-grade code with built-in linting rules.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 16+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (for blockchain features)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or your chosen Ethereum development environment


### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shrikant1a/Seed-Tracking-Dapp---using-Blockchain.git
cd GreenLedger
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Smart Contract Setup

1. Navigate to the Solidity folder.
2. Compile and deploy your smart contracts with your chosen tool (e.g., Hardhat).
3. Copy deployed contract addresses and ABIs into the frontend as needed.
